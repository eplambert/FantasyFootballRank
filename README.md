I analyzed 24 quarterbacks, 81 receivers, and 50 runningbacks. The motivation for this project was to use data collected from 2013 to dominate my fantasy football league. All data was collected from ESPN.com. I did not consider rookies in any analysis due to the level assumption required to make the leap from college level play versus pro level play.

All attributes except age, quality rushing team, team pass offensive rank, and depth chart position; where normalized against the mean to eliminate bias.

QB prediction was based on 10 attributes:

Games Played in 2013
Completion Percentage
Passing Yards
Touchdowns
Rushing Yards
Rushing and Passing Touchdowns per Game
Yards per Game
Completions per Game
Interceptions per Game
Attempts per Game

RB prediction was based on 13 attributes:

Number of Total Team Offensive Plays in 2013
Games Played in 2013
Rushing Attempts
Receptions
Targets
Rushing Yards
Rushing Yards per Game
Rushes versus Total Offensive Plays
Receptions versus Total Offensive Plays
Catches versus Targets
Age
Quality Rushing Team
Touchdowns

WR prediction was based on 13 attributes:

Games Played 2013
First Downs per Game
Touchdowns per Game
Targets per Game
Catches per Game
Yards per Game
Catch per Target
Team Pass Offense Rank
Playerâ€™s Depth Chart Status
